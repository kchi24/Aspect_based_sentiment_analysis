# Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This is a preliminary project experimenting with aspect-based sentiment analysis on Vietnamese text data. The goal is to identify sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) for different aspects mentioned in user reviews or feedback.

## Workflow
1. Collected raw Vietnamese text data.  
2. Preprocessed and cleaned the text.  
3. Extracted relevant aspects from the text.  
4. Labeled sentiment for each aspect.  
5. Trained a multi-class sentiment classification model.  

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn  
- Huggingface Transformers

## Notes
This project is still a work in progress and serves as a learning experiment. The results and models are not yet fully optimized or production-ready.
